# Dave the Discord bot

Dave is written for the gaming community [Requiem of a pickaxe](www.requiemofapickaxe.com), but can easily be used by anyone. The ambition is to make the experience for members of large servers better by reducing server-wide mentions and simplifying common tasks for administrators. 

## Available commands

In order to be in line with how Discord normally works, Dave will only respond to a command if you mention him using the @ symbol.

 * Ping "@Dave ping @personinchannel content" allows the user to mention everyone in a specific voice channel without having to type out all of their names. All you have to do is mention one person that is in the channel at the time.  
 * Hello "@Dave hello" is a simple greetings command
 * Help "@Dave help" prints out a list of all commands available.
